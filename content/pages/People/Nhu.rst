=============

I graduated from the University of Natural Sciences in Ho Chi Minh City with a 1st class honours degree and then continued at the University of Natural Sciences, studying a Masters degree in Microbiology. During the course, I got performed my Masters project at Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Ho Chi Minh City under the supervision of Prof. Stephen Baker, in which I determined the genes responsible for third cephalosporin resistance in *Shigella sonnei*. After graduating, I began to work at OUCRU as a research assistant, and had been conducting research investigating the relationship of antimicrobial resistance and genotype in Gram-negative bacteria. I am familiar with basic molecular and bacteriological techniques such as PCR, but also several advanced methods, including site directed mutagenesis and genome sequencing. 

I am interested in using Next Generation Sequencing to study antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity in bacteria. Following my interest, I moved to Brisbane to start my PhD under supervision of Professor Mark Schembri and A/Prof. Scott Beason. My project is focusing on pathogenicity islands and antibiotic resistance in uropathogenic *E. coli* ST131, which has emerging as a multidrug resistant pathogen worldwide.
 
Outside of working, I really enjoy going out with my family, playing with my little girl, and baking.
